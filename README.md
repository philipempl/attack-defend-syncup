# Attack-Defend-SyncUp

## Overview

**Attack-Defend-SyncUp** is a comprehensive project aimed at bridging the gap between known cybersecurity vulnerabilities (CVEs) and automated defense mechanisms (playbooks). This repository provides tools and data for analyzing over 250,000 CVEs and 1,200 defense playbooks, offering valuable insights into the interplay between cyber threats and defensive strategies.

## Features

- **Extensive CVE Dataset**: Over 250,000 CVEs with detailed descriptions, scores, and associated attack techniques.
- **Defense Playbooks**: Collection of 1,200 playbooks in standardized formats for various mitigation techniques.
- **Mapping and Analysis Tools**: Jupyter Notebook for mapping CVEs to defense playbooks and analyzing their effectiveness.
- **Visualization and Reporting**: Generate visual reports to better understand threat landscapes and defense mechanisms.

### Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Open the notebook**:
    Navigate to the  `attack_defend_syncup.ipynb`.

3. **Explore and analyze the data**:
    Follow the steps in the notebook to explore, process, and analyze the CVE and playbook data. The notebook includes:
    - Data loading and preprocessing
    - Mapping CVEs to playbooks
    - Visualizing relationships and insights
